Reviewer 1:
Code runs correctly. Again, I get an error about the gutter, but I think that's just my emulator, not the coding in the app. There are two window, a collegiate landing page and a personal professional page. The second page does have more information on Craig in relation to his career goals. There is a clearly visible button that serves as navigation between the two windows and the code seems to run as intended. I am unable to run devices other than web, but when I resize my web page the text, photos, and buttons seem to adjust proportionally and appropriately.
